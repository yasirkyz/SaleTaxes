# Sales Taxes Solution

For running the project on command line just write the code "java -jar salestaxes_runnable.jar". 
Then write the option for choosing a specific input for example 1,2 or 3 and then it will give the output. I have added the source files and the runnable jar file in email. The runnable jar file I have added in the Git Repository.
